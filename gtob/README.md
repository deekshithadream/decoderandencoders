Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ by only one bit. This property makes it useful in applications like error correction, digital communication, and Karnaugh maps.
The Most Significant Bit (MSB) of the binary code is always the same as the MSB of the Gray code.
Gray Code: 01101
- First binary bit = same as Gray MSB → 0
- Next bit: 0 XOR 1 → 1
- Next bit: 1 XOR 1 → 0
- Next bit: 0 XOR 0 → 0
- Next bit: 0 XOR 1 → 1
Binary Code: 01001
