A 3-to-8 decoder is a combinational logic circuit that takes 3 input lines and produces 8 output lines. It is used to decode a 3-bit binary input into one of eight possible outputs.
**How It Works**
- The decoder has 3 input bits (A, B, C) and 8 output lines (Y0 to Y7).
- Each output corresponds to a unique combination of the input bits.
- Only one output is active (logic 1) at a time, while the rest remain inactive (logic 0).
- The circuit typically includes AND gates to generate the outputs based on the input conditions.
